### VII Interference Microscopy

An important application of optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is in [microscopy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/optical-microscopy "Learn more about microscopy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Interference microscopy provides a noncontact method for studies of surface structure when stylus profiling cannot be used because of the risk of damage. In the Mirau [interferometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/interferometer "Learn more about interferometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") shown in Fig. 4, light from the microscope illuminator is incident, through the objective, on a semitransparent mirror. The transmitted beam goes to the test surface, while the reflected beam goes to a reference surface. These two beams are recombined at the same semitransparent mirror and return through the objective. The interference pattern formed in the image plane contours the deviations from flatness of the test surface. Very accurate measurements of surface profiles and estimates of roughness can be made using the digital phase-shifting technique.

FIGURE 4. The Mirau interferometer.

Another application of interference microscopy is for studies of transparent living cells that cannot be stained without damaging them. The Nomarski interferometer, which is commonly used for such work, is a [shearing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/shearing "Learn more about shearing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") interferometer that uses two [Wollaston](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/wollaston "Learn more about Wollaston from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (polarizing) prisms to split and recombine the beams. Two methods of observation are possible. With small isolated objects it is convenient to use a lateral shear larger than the dimensions of the object. Two images of the object are then seen, covered with fringes that contour the phase changes due to the object. With an extended object the shear is made much smaller than the dimensions of the object. The interference pattern then shows the [phase gradient](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/phase-gradient "Learn more about phase gradient from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

### Principles of Stellar Interferometry

Stellar [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is based on eqn [3]. The [light emitted](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/emitted-light "Learn more about light emitted from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") by double or wide stars is noncoherent, so that one can access an image of them trough 2D measurements of the degree of coherence of light. We showed above that one could achieve this by using interference devices such as Young holes. Eqn [3] shows that if we measure the visibility of Young fringes at increasing distances δρ between the pinholes, the distance Δρ from which the visibility is zero gives the [angular width](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angular-width "Learn more about angular width from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the star, Δα, under the formula:

[9]Δρ-Δα∼λ

where Δα = Δ*r*/*d*. In the case of a double star, the visibility varies periodically versus δρ when the pinholes are aligned along the axis of two stars. Let Δα be the [angular distance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angular-distance "Learn more about angular distance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") between the stars: the smallest distance Δρ for which the visibility is zero is given by:

[10]Δρ-Δα=λ/2

The larger the uttermost distance between the holes, the more the limit of resolution of the processing is potentially sharp.

In order to exploit this idea, Stephan placed and rotated a mask with two holes in front of the objective of a refractive telescope. He established that the diameter of the stars he observed was much less than 0.16 sec. of arc. Then, Michelson built up, on top of a 30 cm refractive telescope, a stellar [interferometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/interferometer "Learn more about interferometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") consisting of two arms catching the light at 7 m of distance from each other (Figure 14). He measured correctly the diameter of the satellites of Jupiter. Hale carried the distance of the base up to 15 m in 1920.

### 4.1 Film Thickness Measurements

Optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has proved to be a valuable tool in studying the behaviour of two-phase lubricants. However conventional interferometry is limited to a minimum measurable film thickness of approximately 70 nm (26). A modification of this method is ultra [thin film](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/thin-films "Learn more about thin film from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") interferometry, which enables the accurate measurement of very [thin films](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/thin-films "Learn more about thin films from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") down to 1 nm by introducing a spacer layer which augments the oil film and a spectrometer to detect small variations in interference wavelength (27).

The test rig is shown in figure 5. A contact is formed between a highly-polished steel ball (AISI 52100, 19 mm diameter) and a chromium and silica-coated, glass disc. The ball sits on a bearing carriage that holds the ball in a fixed position axially. The composite [surface roughness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/surface-roughness "Learn more about surface roughness from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the surfaces is 11 nm. The ball and disc can be driven independently to produce controlled sliding/rolling motion.

Figure 5. EHD film thickness rig

All tests were carried out at a controlled temperature of 25 °C or 30 °C ± 0.5 °C and a load of 20 N, which gave a mean Hertz contact pressure of 0.52 GPa. For each test, a new steel ball was used and all the relevant rig parts were thoroughly cleaned using analytical grade toluene and acetone. Both ball and glass disc were cleaned by immersion in boiling toluene and acetone. The rig was then assembled and the load applied mechanically against the underside of the disc. Before lubricant was supplied to the surfaces, the spacer layer thickness was measured at a fixed position on the disc. Thereafter, film thickness measurements were triggered at the same position so that the lubricant film thickness could be determined from the difference between the measured separation and the spacer layer thickness.

For each colloid system studied, film thickness tests measurements were carried out with the base fluid, the base fluid plus the dispersant and the colloidal dispersion itself.

To validate the ultra-thin interferometry technique, a series of tests were carried out using the 150 SN mineral oil. Figure 6 shows repeated test results. These tests show good repeatability to within 3 nm in the low speed range.

### Surface Topography and Object Structure Measurement

Although [WLI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about WLI from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has many applications, this section focuses on white light interference as applied to [surface topography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/surface-topography "Learn more about surface topography from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") measurement. Interference microscopes that use white light illumination are often based on the [Michelson](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/michelson "Learn more about Michelson from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") setup shown in Figure 11.

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B0123693950008228-gr11.jpg)

Figure 11. Michelson interferometric objective.

A [beamsplitter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/beamsplitters "Learn more about beamsplitter from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") [cube](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/cubic-crystal "Learn more about cube from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is placed underneath the bright field objective, and one mirror is placed to the side at the focus plane of the objective while the other mirror is replaced by the measured surface with respect to which the whole interference objective is scanned. The narrowly localized fringes at the best focus position for each point of the surface corresponding to a pixel on the CCD camera is observed during the scan. Because of the design of the Michelson objective, in order to accommodate higher magnification objectives constraints, other interference setups like Mirau and Linnik were developed (*see* **Microscopy:** Interference Microscopy). However, these designs are still based on the Michelson [interferometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/interferometer "Learn more about interferometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), being also compensated [interferometers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/interferometer "Learn more about interferometers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with equal lengths and amounts of glass in each arm.

These interference microscopes typically have two complementary modes of operation; one mode uses monochromatic illumination and the other employs a white light source. Monochromatic illumination provides excellent vertical resolution but is limited in its range. It cannot correctly assign fringe order to discontinuous surfaces larger than 160 [nanometers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nanometre "Learn more about nanometers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Figure 12a shows monochromatic fringes for the surface of the profile shown in Figure 13. We see that with the monochromatic illumination the height of the grooves remains unknown because it is impossible to assign order numbers to these fringes.

Figure 13. 3D object profile -- binary grating.

To resolve this ambiguity, white light illumination is employed because it allows for easy identification of the zero order fringe. Figure 12b shows white light fringes created for the same surface. We see the zero-order fringe for the zero [OPD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/optical-paths "Learn more about OPD from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as well as the next orders due to the decreasing contrast of the fringes. The position of the zero-order fringe can be followed and approximate heights can be determined visually. Thus, white light illumination permits the measurement of a broader range of surfaces that are rough or have large height variations up to a few millimeters.

The white light interferometer is a great focus detector (Figure 14) at each point of the [field of view](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/field-of-view "Learn more about field of view from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The principle behind WLI is finding these individual focus positions using localized fringes observed during the surface scan. WLI interferometers provide high [lateral resolution](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/lateral-resolution "Learn more about lateral resolution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and large vertical range in the order of hundreds of nanometers or micrometers (Figure 15). White light interferometers are commonly used to measure magnetic heads, [MEMS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/micro-electro-mechanical-system "Learn more about MEMS from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") devices, binary [optic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/optics "Learn more about optic from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and machined surfaces.

#### Signal Processing of White Light Interferograms

For WLI topographic measurements, each pixel registers an [interferogram](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferogram from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") whose position varies with the surface height. Figure 16 shows two [interferograms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for two positions in the field of view of a measured step height surface; the first shows the top surface of the step height and the second shows the bottom surface of the step height.

Figure 16. White light fringes as seen by two pixels during scan through focus for object in form of step.

Algorithms have been developed to analyze the signal in different ways. Some focus on finding the fringe envelope position and others examine the position of the fringe underneath the envelope. These algorithms work under the assumption that white light fringes can be described by the same function over the whole field of view of the interferometer. Algorithms are applied to a signal so as to find the position of the coherence envelope for each pixel. This process is called coherence gating, and all algorithms perform coherence gating.

Some algorithms look for the position of the envelope's maximum in a process whereby first the coherence envelope of the fringes is found using signal filtering. Then, the curve is fit to a few points around the envelope's maximum, and finally the position of the envelope's maximum is found. Other algorithms calculate the center of mass of the coherence signal, as described in eqn [8]:

[8]Hx,y=∑n=1N-1Iix,y-Ii+1x,y2zi∑n=1N-1Iix,y-Ii+1x,y2

This method is very fast and computationally efficient. Center of mass calculations are equivalent to calculations of the maximum of the envelope position, but only for a symmetrical signal. For an asymmetrical signal a piston is introduced for each point; however, this piston does not affect the whole measurement. Still another method calculates the spectral phase slope in the [Fourier domain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fourier-transform "Learn more about Fourier domain from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to determine the position of the coherence envelope in a process that is equivalent to finding the center of mass. Finally, a different group of algorithms tracks the position of the bright or dark fringe close to the envelope's maximum.

#### Scanner Speed -- Sampling Rate

A practical sampling rate of the white light interference signal is around four pixels per fringe. Because in most algorithms it is not the position of the fringes that we want to determine but rather the position of the envelope of the fringes, sampling the envelope of the fringes with four samples is usually sufficient. However, this sufficiency comes at the expense of lower repeatability (higher noise). The advantage to this sampling rate is short measurement time; higher sampling rates increase measurement time. Measurement speed can be increased by up to 25 times when the envelope of the fringes is widened by filtering light of a bandwidth about 20--40 nm from the white light source.

#### Scanner Nonlinearity

Scanner motion is assumed to be linear, but nonlinearity in this motion impairs measurement accuracy. To account for this, simple algorithms can calculate the average steps along each interferogram in scanning direction (Figure 17) and measured steps can be used in coherence [detection algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/detection-algorithm "Learn more about detection algorithms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B0123693950008228-gr17.jpg)

Figure 17. Phase calculated along the white light interferogram. This calculated phase can be used to determine scanner motion.

In order to have continuous information about the scan steps, the fringes should be visible somewhere in the field of view at each moment of the scan. This task may require introducing a large tilt for samples with large discontinuities such as stepped surfaces. For large discontinuities where introducing sample tilt may not be sufficient, the envelope of the fringes can be extended by increasing the spatial or temporal coherence of the light source. An alternate solution involves measuring the scanner motion with a distance-measuring interferometer or triggering the camera to collect intensity data at every equal scan step, which can be determined by using the zero-crossing technique, as is commonly done in [Fourier transform](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fourier-transform "Learn more about Fourier transform from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") spectroscopy. Equal scan steps are more suitable for techniques based on transform techniques that assume equal sampling. Other peak detection algorithms, such as center of mass calculations, make use of measured but not necessarily equal steps directly in the algorithm.

Observing the phase along the interferogram can also provide information that is important in [optical fiber](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optical-fiber "Learn more about optical fiber from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") sensing. These observed changes, which assume that sampling rates of the interferogram are known, enable correction for changes in wave number value *k*~0~ which can be due to such things as changes in the working voltage of bulb, an introduced higher-order dispersion, or a large tilt of the sample.

#### Increased Resolution White Light Interferometry

[Interferometric methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/interferometric-method "Learn more about Interferometric methods from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that employ a monochromatic light source to detect the phase of the fringes (*see* **Interferometry:** Phase Measurement Interferometry) can achieve about 10 times better (0.3 nanometers versus 3 nanometers) vertical resolution than the WLI methods described so far. Combining coherence position detection from WLI to determine fringe order with the phase detection of phase shifting techniques allows for the measurement of samples with height discontinuities larger than 160 nanometers with the resolution and accuracy of phase shifting [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (PSI). This combination is particularly well-suited for determining the shape of smooth surfaces with large height differences such as binary [diffractive optics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/diffractive-optics "Learn more about diffractive optics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) (see Figure 15).

Using this combined method we obtain both a lower-resolution map of the envelope position and a higher-resolution map of the phase (position) of the zero order fringe. These maps may differ slightly due to effects similar to those discussed in sections *Changes in Envelope and Fringes Due to Reflection of Nondielectric* and *Changes in Envelope and Fringes Due to Dispersion* above. In interference microscopes, shifts in the envelope and fringe position may be introduced by field-dependent and [chromatic aberrations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/chromatic-aberration "Learn more about chromatic aberrations from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the system and the system's effective [numerical aperture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/numerical-aperture "Learn more about numerical aperture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). These shifts can vary for different points on the tested surface, but for simplicity are assumed to be constant over the field. Some correction for these effects can be applied.

#### Film Thickness Measurement

White light interferograms that are obtained in an optical profiler can be used to measure transparent film thicknesses because the character of the interferogram changes with the thickness of the film (Figure 18). Two different techniques, a thin or [thick film](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/thick-films "Learn more about thick film from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") technique, are used depending of the range of the film thickness. A thick film technique is used if two sets of best contrast white light fringes from each interface are clearly separated, meaning that no interference occurs between the wavefronts reflected from the top and bottom surfaces of the film. A [thin film](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/thin-films "Learn more about thin film from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") technique is employed when the two sets of fringes overlap.

Figure 18. Fringes for (a) thin and (b) thick film.

##### Thick film measurement

A simple technique for finding the relative position of the peaks of the fringe envelopes can be implemented to find the thickness of a film. Figure 19 shows two clearly separated sets of fringes formed for the air/film and film/substrate interfaces. Whether these two sets of fringes are separated or not depends mainly on the geometrical thickness of the film and its group [index of refraction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/index-of-refraction "Learn more about index of refraction from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), which is determined by the dispersion of the film. The typical range of measurable film thicknesses runs from 3 to 150 microns, depending on the dispersion of the film. This measurement allows for the detection of flows on the surface and interface of the film. Similar principles based on finding the position of the coherence envelopes are used for distance sensing, thickness measurement of plates, and the cornea of the eye, in low coherence reflectometry and structure measurements in biological samples in optical coherence [tomography](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/tomography "Learn more about tomography from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

Figure 19. Thick film (see Figure 18b) irradiance.

##### Thin film measurement

For thicknesses of five microns down to tens of nanometers, the white light interferogram is created from the interference between the beams reflected from the reference mirror and the two beams reflected from the thin film layer. Once the interferogram is registered while the objective is scanned vertically with a [constant velocity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/constant-velocity "Learn more about constant velocity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the spectral phase is calculated by applying a Fourier transform to the measured signal at each pixel as described in the section *[Fourier Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/fourier-analysis "Learn more about Fourier Analysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* *of White Light* *[Interferograms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")* above. The phase slope is subtracted and the dispersion of the system needs to be known. The spectral phase for the thin film interference has the form of a polynomial; thus, the polynomial for the chosen film model (n and k) is fitted, and regression analysis is used to find the best fit and, therefore, the film thickness (Figure 20).

#### Spatial Coherence Effects in the Interference Microscope

So far we have been discussing temporal coherence effects, but everywhere that the source has a wavelength bandwidth, spatial coherence may play an important role. In an interference microscope for surface topography measurement, the size of the aperture of the condenser is on the order of the aperture of the objective that illuminates the surface with a wide range of angles. For large angles, which are determined by the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, where NA=0.5--0.95, the combination of the influence of the spatial and temporal coherence is clearly visible. The additional spatial effects include a reduction of the fringe envelope width and a decrease in fringe spacing corresponding to *k*~0~. Calibration of fringe spacing is typically done on the system and accounts for spatial effects as well as for any uncertainty of *k*~0~ due to the source spectra, the working temperature of the source, the [spectral response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/spectral-response "Learn more about spectral response from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the detector and the influence of other factors like the intensity distribution in the illuminating aperture. The spatial influences can be reduced by stopping down the condenser, which causes an increase in the contrast of the fringes.

#### Rough Surfaces

Rough surfaces are difficult to measure using interferometric techniques, but under certain coherence conditions white light interference can do the job. For rough surfaces, if the microstructure of the object is not resolved by the imaging system, speckles, rather than fringes, are observed. Each speckle has a random phase which is approximately constant in the whole speckle area. If the rough surface is scanned through focus, each individual speckle exhibits the [intensity modulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/intensity-modulation "Learn more about intensity modulation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that is typical for WLI. These speckles enable the measurement, but they also introduce noise proportional to the roughness of the measured surface.

Despite the noise that speckles introduce into the WLI measurement, WLI has an advantage because it rejects the light that has undergone scattering outside of a small sample volume, thus allowing precise noninvasive measurement of object structure, even in dense media.

### Stellar Intensity Interferometry

Michelson stellar interferometry can resolve stars which have [angular sizes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angular-size "Learn more about angular sizes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the order of 0.01", since for smaller stars, the separation between the primary mirrors runs into several meters and maintaining stability of mirrors such that the optical paths do not change, even by fraction of a wavelength, is extremely difficult. The [atmospheric turbulence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/atmospheric-turbulence "Learn more about atmospheric turbulence from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") further adds to this problem and obtaining stable [fringe pattern](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/diffraction-pattern "Learn more about fringe pattern from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") becomes next to impossible for very small stars. Hanbury-Brown and Twiss applied the intensity interferometry based on their [photoelectric](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/photoelectricity "Learn more about photoelectric from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") correlation technique for determining the angular sizes of such stars. Two separate [parabolic mirrors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/parabolic-mirror "Learn more about parabolic mirrors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") collected light from the star and the output of the [photodetectors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/photodetector "Learn more about photodetectors from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") placed at the focus of each mirror was sent to a [correlator](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/correlator "Learn more about correlator from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The cable lengths were made unequal so as to compensate for the time difference of the light arrival at the two mirrors. The normalized correlation of the fluctuations of the [photocurrents](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/photocurrent "Learn more about photocurrents from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") was determined as described above. This would give the variation of the modulus-squared degree of coherence as a function of the mirror separation *d* from which the [angular size](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angular-size "Learn more about angular size from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the stars can be estimated. The advantage of the stellar intensity [interferometer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/interferometer "Learn more about interferometer from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") over the stellar (amplitude) interferometer is that the light need not interfere as in the latter, since the photodetectors are mounted directly at the focus of the primary mirrors of the telescope. Thus, the constraint on the large path difference between the two beams is removed and large values of *d* can now be used. Moreover, the atmosphere turbulence and the mirror movements have very small effect. Stellar angular diameters as small as 0.0004" of arc with resolution of 0.00003" could be measured by such interferometers.

### 4.3 Experimental technique principle

Conventional optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is based on the interference colours comparison between an unknown film and a film of known thickness. Although the human eye can discern thousands of colour shades and intensities, the resolution of this method is only about 50 nm. A newly developed technique replaces human eye by simple differential colorimeter for interference colour evaluation, so that its resolution is 20 times better [12]. The lubricant film thickness is determined by comparing L* (psychometric lightness), a* (redness-greenness), b* (yellowness-blueness) colour coordinates between digital colour chart and digitised EHD [interferogram](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferogram from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with the help of CIE 1976 L*a*b* colour-difference equation.

The digital colour chart contains values of L*, a*, b* colour coordinates with corresponding film thickness from 40 to 800 nm with the difference of nm. Figure 2 shows the correspondence between L*, a*, b* colour coordinates and the film thickness.

Figure 2. L*,a*,b* colour coordinates as a function of the film thickness.

Values of colour coordinates were obtained from chromatic interferogram of a static contact and the film thickness values from monochromatic interferogram of the same contact. The use of a fringe skeletonizing procedure enabled the precise adjoining of values of colour coordinates to the film thickness.

Digitised EHD [interferograms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferograms from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were converted from YCC colour space, used by Kodak Photo CD System, to LAB colour space. This colour space is suitable for the evaluation of colour interferograms because of: (**1**) its perceptual uniformity; (**2**) its device-independence; and (**3**) an establishment of the colour-difference equation. Figure 3 depicts an example of the location of interference colours from interferogram for rolling speed of 0.101 m/s in CIE a*, b* chromaticity diagram. The values of digital colour chart are represented by solid line.

### 9 X-ray and Neutron Interferometry

Visible light interferometry is widely used for metrology in visible light optics and increasingly with ultraviolet (UV) and soft X-rays. X-ray interferometry is an important potential tool in astronomy, X-ray diagnostics, and metrology in general. [Neutron interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/neutron-interferometry "Learn more about Neutron Interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") can be used to provide accurate measurement of neutron scatter lengths and is applied to research in quantum mechanics and gravitation. Two categories of interferometry devices are (1) division of wave fronts and (2) division of amplitude. In visible light optics, the division of wave fronts is accomplished via the Young double-slit interferometer, and the division of amplitudes is accomplished by the Michelson interferometer. Interferometry in optics in general, and X-rays and neutrons specifically, require splitting an incident ray at a single point into two rays that follow separate paths that then converge to a single point, in which the beams are then recombined with constructive and destructive summing of their amplitudes. The squared magnitude of the summed amplitudes produces a modulated intensity pattern that is characteristic of the phase shift differences incurred between the two ray paths from a single source point to a single image point.

Consider a monochromatic, small disk source of wave amplitude *A*~0~, in which two very small diameter beams of equal amplitudes *A*~0~/2 (conservation of neutrons) emerge at angles *θ* and -*θ* about the center *z*-axis. The beams travel a long object distance *r*~0~ and intercept a neutron lens as plane waves. The lens refracts the two beams to converge to a locus of points in the image plane at image distance *r~i~*. The transverse coherence length of each beam exceeds the radius of the image disk that conjugate to the source disk. The focal length *f* of the lens is half the object *r*~0~ and *r~i~* image distances so that *r*~0~ = *r~i~* the magnification is unity *M* = 1.

The beams have traveled different total path lengths *L*~1~ and *L*~2~ from the source to image planes. Each beam is transverse coherent, such that the beams undergo constructive and destructive interference in the image plane. The amplitude *A~r~* of the recombined pair of beams at the image plane is, then,

(168)Ar=A02(r0+ri)expi2πλL1+ϕ1+expi2πλL2+ϕ2

where

(169)r0+ri≅L1,L2.

One assumes that the beam path lengths *L*~1~ and *L*~2~ are approximately equal to the axial distance *r*~0~ + *r~i~* between the source and image planes in the amplitude magnitude term. The intensity *I~r~* of the recombining pair of beams at the image plane is, then,

(170)Ir=Ar2=12I01+cosw1-w2⋅t+2πλL1-L2+ϕ1-ϕ2

where

(171)I0=A0(r0+ri)2.

At room temperature, the thermal neutron velocity *v* = 2.2 × 10^5^ cm/s and the wavelength is λ = 1.8 × 10^-8^ cm/s, so that

(172)w=7.7×1013rad∕sec.

For a 10% bandwidth with *w*~1~ = *w* and *w*~2~ = *w*(1 ± 0.05), the variation of the neutron wave frequency is 3.8 THz, where

(173)w1-w2=w-w1±0.1=±0.1w=3.8×1012rad∕s.

The maximum *I*~max~ and minimum *I*~min~ intensities of the recombined waves are

(174)Imax=I0andImin=I.

The contrast *C* is defined as

(175)C=Imax-IminImax+Imin=1.

The interference pattern rapidly oscillates between *I*~max~ and *I*~min~ at 3.8 THz, in which the time-averaged interference pattern is then,

(176)Ir=Ar2=12I01+cos2πλL1-L2+φ1-φ2,

where

(177)<cosw1-w2⋅t>=1T∫0TcosΔw⋅t=1T∫0Tcos2πtT=0.

The spacing between adjacent maxima *I*~max~ and minima *I*~min~ is one-half period *P*, and the spacing between maxima pairs or between minima pairs is then

(178)P=λ.

The interference pattern is shifted by phase Φ, where

(179)Φ=ϕ1-ϕ2.

The phase shift Φ can arise if one path contains an object whose length and refractive index causes a phase shift. The optical length difference Δ*L* in the two paths can be varied so as to generate the interference pattern as a function of Δ*L*, where *n*~1~ and *n*~2~ are the refractive indexes of the mediums in paths 1 and 2 and

(180)ΔL=n1L1-n2L2.

The intensity of the interference pattern of the combined waves is then

(181)Ir=Ar2=12I01+cos2πPΔL+Φ.

### Publisher Summary

Many applications of optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") involve measurements of the local variations of shape or [refractive index](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/refractivity "Learn more about refractive index from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). This chapter discusses the interferometry of refractive index fields. [Interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about Interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is widely used in the studies of fluid flow, combustion, heat transfer, plasmas, and [diffusion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/diffusivity "Learn more about diffusion from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") where local variations in refractive index can be related to changes in the pressure, the temperature, or the relative concentration of different components. An important application of optical interferometry is in microscopy. Interference microscopy provides a noncontact method for studies of the structure and measurements of the roughness of specular surfaces when stylus profiling cannot be used because of the risk of damage. The chapter also describes the techniques used in interference microscopy---multiple-beam interference, two-beam interference microscopes, and the Nomarski interferometer.

### 4.1 Setup

The duochromatic optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") technique [25] was used to measure the shape and thickness of the lubricant film in an EHL circular contact. The experimental equipment used in this investigation is a ball and disc apparatus as schematically described in Figure (3).

The duochromatic interference [fringe pattern](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/diffraction-pattern "Learn more about fringe pattern from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), obtained by a xenon light source with a flash duration of 20 *μs* through red and green filters, was recorded with a high-speed VCR (200 frames per second) and a 35-mm camera attached to a microscope.

The lubricant used is a mineral bright stock and was held at room temperature. Results will be presented for pure rolling (Σ = 0) with a rolling velocity of 0.024, 0.048 and 0.096 *m*/*s*. The load is kept constant at 39.2 *N* giving a maximum Hertzian pressure of 0.54 GPa, and a Hertzian contact radius of 0.185 *mm.* The parameter values and the values of various sets of non-dimensional parameters for these contact conditions are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.

A two parameter least square fit against a sinusoidal function gives a wavelength of 60 *μm* and an amplitude of 0.14 *μm*. Taking different parts of the trace the wavelength varies little. However, the amplitude varies between 0.13 and 0.16 *μm*, depending on the part of the trace taken in the least square fit. Table 2 also gives the values of the ∇ parameter obtained assuming λ = 60 *μm*.

In the following section the measured film thickness will be presented and compared with the results obtained with full numerical simulations using input from the profile. It is also verified to what extend the change of the amplitude of the film thickness oscillations in the center of the contact with speed matches the predicted behaviour.

### 1 INTRODUCTION

The technique of using optical [interferometry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/interferometry "Learn more about interferometry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the evaluation of film thickness in elastohydrodynamically lubricated contacts have been widely used since it was introduced by Cameron and Gohar [1] in 1966. Further development was accomplished by Foord et al. [2] who described in depth the parameters used and their relations in an optical design sense. However, the actual film thickness determination resulting from images captured during experiments, was a tedious task to evaluate since the operator had to keep track of the fringe order, in monochromatic experiments, and the additional colour information if white- or multi wavelength light were used. Using this information, it was possible to calculate the surface separation at chosen points using the fundamental equations of interferometry. Even though the method was well understood and could give results which increased the understanding in elastohydrodynamics, the accuracy and ability to measure [thin films](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/thin-films "Learn more about thin films from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") were limited. By illuminating the contact with a short wavelength [monochromatic light](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/monochromatic-light "Learn more about monochromatic light from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), but detectable with the eye, the thinnest film possible to measure was about 100-150 nm and the resolution not better than 70-80 nm. The resolution was restricted by the fact that maximum intensity fringes had to be used in choosing the calculation points. By using multi-wavelength light the resolution increased to 25-50 nm.

Measuring lubricant film thicknesses in EHD contacts down to a theoretical zero level using interferometry can be done by introducing a spacer layer. The technique of adding a spacer layer on top of a semi reflective coating, solved the lower limit problem, Westlake and Cameron 1967 [3]. This approach raises the measurable limit by the spacer layer's thickness as an offset film thickness.

Johnston et al.[4] implemented a spectrograph which made it possible to extract a film thickness profile with higher accuracy and a very high resolution. The drawback is that one dimension in the normally two dimensional [interferogram](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/interferometry "Learn more about interferogram from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") is sacrificed for a dimension with wavelength dispersion.

Using computer aided image analysis, Gustafsson et al.[5], the HSI colour calibration method, were able to measure film thicknesses over the whole contact and produce a detailed 2-dimensional map. This required a calibration image where the interferogram corresponds to a known shape. A calibration table could thus be produced. This table couples film thickness to the measured hue, saturation and intensity (HSI). This procedure involves some problems but was a big step in reducing analysis time and increase measurement accuracy. The Multi channel [6][7] technique presented here, avoids the unwanted effects of the calibration procedure. Instead, having a "calibrated" light source with channels obeying certain relationships, gives the necessary information without geometrical assumptions. This is a major advantage in the aspect that the method can be used in other applications than the normal ball and disc setup. It does not rely on experimental geometry setup and gives the opportunity to measure very thin films for, virtually, any shape.
